[Support Discord](https://discord.gg/KRwX5tKxYd)

### How to Install
Copy `./dist/DisplayNotifs.plugin.js` to your BetterDiscord plugins folder.
If you are using windows, you can run the `copyToBD` script using npm or yarn, and that should work.

### How to Contribute
1. Clone repo, set up your code editor
2. Run `npm i`, or `yarn i` (or whatever you use)
3. Code in `src` and associated folders.
4. When done, run `npm run build` or `yarn build` to transpile the plugin in `dist`, or alternatively use `npm run ci` or `yarn ci` to build and attempt to copy it to your BD plugins folder. (Copying works on Windows only atm.)
5. Loop 3-4.
6. Make a PR/issue/shout from the Himalayas at me, I might be able to listen.
